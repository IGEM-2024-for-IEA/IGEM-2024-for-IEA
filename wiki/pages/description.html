      <h4>PFAS, or "forever chemicals," are ubiquitous and cause cancers, infertility, birth defects, vaccine resistance, and other serious health problems at very low concentrations. Current methods to degrade PFAS are costly and could result in a highly toxic byproduct. Our high school iGEM team is using AI to design enzymes that will destroy PFAS chemicals. Once we have perfected the design, we will test our novel enzymes experimentally, using a cutting-edge high-throughput testing method. We are working at a lab at Caltech and are trying to raise funds to allow our team to pay the iGEM fees and to travel to Paris from Pasadena, California.</h4>

    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</p>
